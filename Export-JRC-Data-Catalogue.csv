Three cameras were selected on intersections in Tallinn to train the application to count the vehicles passing by the cameras. The training of the application was a crucial process in developing the solution since there was no ready-made solution available that suited the circumstances of Tallinn. The result is an application that uses machine vision to count buses, cars, lorries and motorcycles and in the future hopefully also pedestrians, cyclists and like with a 70% accuracy on the traffic load in a certain area when previously there no such information available at all.

146,EHPS - Early help profiling system to identify children and families considered vulnerable, ,"A predictive system called the ""Early Help Profiling System (EHPS)"" used in Hackney County (London), which uses data from a variety of different sources to identify children and families considered vulnerable and at risk of child abuse to the municipality. The data includes statistics from different government agencies, such as school attendance, housing information, economic indicators, and others. This allows early intervention to these families, avoiding the occurrence of a crisis with more expensive follow-up actions.  Each month, the social workers team gets a list of 20 families who are of high risk and unknown to the social workers at that time. Social workers then decide based on the information to conduct an early intervention, such as support from a child centre or a health assessment. It has been reported that the model had a high accuracy, with more than 80% of the risk alerts deemed valid, despite challenges with continuous updating of some data sources. The system was expected to help councils save around one million euro per year by having early, targeted interventions. However, the system was heavily criticized. The nature of the data collection and the risk assessment was very opaque as data is processed by a private company, leading to concerns by citizens. Those whose data was used were not informed and it was kept a secret which indicators were to determine the risks, since a private company was responsible for the development and argued that the information was commercially sensitive. Others noticed that the system was only put in place to cope with the austerity measures put in place, as the system was advertised to maximize payments from the Troubled Families programme.

166,SNS24 Scout.AI - Analyse the information recorded within the SNS 24 TAE Service,"https://www.spms.min-saude.pt/2019/08/spms-recebe-apoio-da-fct-para-projetos-de-ciencia-dos-dados-e-ia/

https://nova-lincs.di.fct.unl.pt/news-single/98","The Portuguese national health service is tax-funded, and otherwise mostly free of charge for the citizens. 
Regarding telephone triage, Portugal has a national free of charge helpline for emergencies (112) and a separate national health service contact center helpline for non-emergent situations (SNS24), at the cost of a local call. Originally established in 1999, SNS24 evolved into a multichannel contact centre with the mission to facilitate the citizen’s access to the public healthcare services. Whilst providing several different services to callers, its core service is the nurse-led triage that uses protocols developed by the governmental public health agency. 
The Triage, Counselling and Referral Service (TAE) is a telephone service provided by the Contact Centre of the National Health Service - SNS 24.

In 2018, more than 1 million calls with an average duration of 7-8 minutes were answered. Being of national scope, this is a service that promotes equity in the access to health care.
Telephone service is provided by nurses and follows pre-defined clinical algorithms. Triage is based on a specific clinical algorithm (out of a set of 59), and the choice of the most appropriate algorithm is extremely important and relevant. 
The selected clinical algorithm should ensure high safety (not failing to identify situations that require urgent medical contact) and should have high discriminatory capability.

In this context, the SNS24 Scout.AI will apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies, aiming the development of decision support tools with two main objectives:
1. Support the nurse in the selection of the most appropriate clinical algorithm.
2. Provide support to Directorate-General of Health (DGS) in the optimization process of the design of clinical algorithms and their referrals.

The first objective will be achieved by identifying the most appropriate algorithms for a given set of symptoms, with adjustment for age and sex. The AI methodology to be applied will be based on a classifier built on automatic learning algorithms on an anonymised data set, obtained from contacts of the SNS 24 in 2017 and 2018. This data represents accumulated experience in around 2 million cases.
After the creation of the prediction model, it will be implemented in the SNS 24 TAE Service as decision support, indicating in real time which algorithms are most likely to be used. 

The second goal is to create a support tool in the process of optimising the design of clinical algorithms and their referrals.
Adding to the data already mentioned the referral and its adequacy, as well as the diagnoses established at hospital level, it will be possible to:
- assess the clinical performance of each referral, when classified in terms of safety and discriminatory capacity;
- predict the impact of potential changes to algorithms in terms of safety and performance;
- predict hospital-level diagnoses for each algorithm or set of symptoms.

With this analysis, it will also be possible to detect any anomalous patterns and allow the DGS to make more informed decisions supported by real world data.

In order to achieve these objectives, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques developed specifically for the Portuguese language will be used, as well as Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). The motto of the texts, the extraction of appointed entities and the creation of lists of bigrams and trigrams, as well as the association with international medical classification systems (International Classification of Diseases), using ontology mapping techniques will be carried out. At ML level, automatic classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and deep
neural networks (e.g. bi-LSTM with attention mechanisms) will be developed. Statistical methodologies will also be applied to detect anomalous situations in the application of clinical algorithms and their referral. Therefore, the SNS24 Scout.AI project will automatically analyse the information recorded within the SNS 24 TAE Service, using a built-in classifier using ML techniques to help nurses select the most appropriate clinical algorithm. It will also support the optimisation of the design in the SNS 24 algorithms by analysing the results of the referral of each case, improving its discriminatory capacity and clinical safety.",National,Portugal,PT,"SPMS - Serviços Partilhados do Ministério da Saúde, EPE",Central-Government,Health,Health n.e.c.,In development,2021,,Reasoning,Knowledge representation,Optimisation,,,,Enforcement,Supporting inspection processes,Artificial Intelligence,G2C,Dynamic Data,Dynamic Data,Improved Public Service,x,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,Survey Use and impact of AI in the public sector. 2021

The target of this subsidy are people who live in houses with a property value of no more than 200 000 euros. These people qualify for subsidies that can help them make their house more sustainable, ranging from 300 to 3000 euros. Allotment normally takes a lot of effort and time, because forms need to be scanned and judged. This process would take up to 6 weeks and cost a lot of manpower, which was often more costly than the subsidy in question. This project aims to optimize the existing process: it is an automation project. We started with a cluster data analysis to target the correct people for this subsidy. When these people apply for a subsidy, their application is examined by an algorithm. If the applications meets the qualifications, the subsidy is automatically awarded. The process is thus reduced from several weeks to a few days. This benefits the applicants, as the subsidy is only awarded after they have implemented the steps to make their house more sustainable. If the algorithm cannot award a subsidy, a human will be involved. This means that subsidies are never automatically rejected. In addition to innovative technical aspects, this case process was also innovative. We worked according to the “garage methodology”, using funnels, scrum, and product owners.

IRIS is the service that allows citizens to report incidents or send complaints to the Barcelona City Council for resolution. Through IRIS, citizens can send information and queries, as well as complaints and suggestions for improvement. In this process, the citizen who reports the incident has to classify it using a tree of topics offered through the computer application. This classification is important because it is used to direct the incident directly to the responsible department, thus speeding up the response process. Errors in the thematic classification cause inadequate responses and delays in the resolution of incidents, thus affecting the quality of the service offered.
As part of the IRIS service update project, a module called MARIO has been developed, based on machine learning algorithms -Machine Learning- and natural language processing (one of the technologies included in the IA) to simplify the incident classification process for citizens. From the analysis of the free text describing the incident, MARIO suggests to the citizen the most likely categories where the incident fits because he/she chooses the most appropriate category.
MARIO, which is currently being tested, minimizes the error rate in the initial classification of incidents by greatly reducing manual reclassification processes. Previously, 50% of the communications made needed to be reassigned; now, with MARIO, a hit rate of over 85% is being achieved.
MARIO has been developed using open source tools -Open Source- such as Python, Scikit-*learn and *Pandas, among others. The algorithm has required a training that has been carried out using a dataset with the topics and questions asked by the citizen previously validated to ensure that they have been correctly classified.
This pilot has been used by the Municipal Institute of Informatics to evaluate the techniques and processes of text classification with the following conclusions:
Often the integration of AI techniques into existing processes has to be accompanied by a restructuring of the data. In the case of IRIS, the wide range of classification options makes the task difficult for a human but makes *IA inefficient. Clustering of categories is recommended
- It is important to have a quality dataset.

The new tool will be able to make such predictions, which together with the prediction of photovoltaic production (or any other renewable resource), will allow the calculation of optimized self-consumption scenarios. Thanks to this technology, users will also be able to adapt their consumption habits to promote self-consumption and, in the future, even offer service to the grid to promote its stability.
The tool is mainly composed of three modules: recruitment, planning and execution. Although AI will be used mainly in the third module, part of its results will also be used in phases one and two to help in system sizing and optimization, allowing the selection of the optimal number of PV panels.

Lawyers are working to clarify this by harmonizing (coordinating) and bringing together (codifying) this fragmented legislation. But this does not yet solve the problem sufficiently. With the project 'Smart Regulations' we want to offer a solution by using Artificial Intelligence to train computers to interpret regulations. For example, computers can very accurately extract the correct information from those regulations for specific target groups (this can be people, applications or machines).  
The goal is therefore to be able to offer an 'engine' on unstructured information sources from legislation, regulations and decision-making that users can subscribe to in order to get data and additional insights from these information sources more quickly according to their needs.

The optical remote-sensing data with 250 m resolution acquired by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2002–2011 were used for statistical characterization of sea ice. A method based on bimodal histogram analysis of remote-sensing reflectance data was developed to discriminate ice from water. In general, ice extent information obtained from MODIS data agrees with the official ice chart data (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and in situ measurements) and multi-sensor product containing data from microwave and infrared instruments (R² >0.83). However, in case of severe winters and extremely mild winters there are differences in the dates when maximum ice extent is registered. MODIS data can be used for detailed analysis of ice extent in specific basins of Baltic Sea. Depending on the year, the ice season length in the Gulf of Riga ranged from 68 to 146 days, and the maximum ice extent varied greatly from 329 to 15,350 km². SIOP and number of ice days increased significantly in areas where the depth is less than 15 m. Based on negative-degree days and ice cover characteristics (SIOP and ice season length), three winter scenarios were defined: severe (2003, 2006, 2010, and 2011), medium (2004 and 2005), and mild (2007, 2008, and 2009).",National,Estonia,EE,Estonian Weather Service,Central-Government,Economic affairs,Transport,Pilot,2017,,Perception,Computer vision,Automated reasoning,,,,"Analysis, monitoring and regulatory research",Information analysis processes,Artificial Intelligence,G2G,Dynamic Data,Location Data,FALSE,,,,,,Improved Administration Efficency,Improved Administrative Efficiency,,x,x,,,,,FALSE,,,,https://www.maaamet.ee/sites/default/files/content-agnes/1_6_liis_sipelgas_kuidas_riigi_ilmateenistus_kasutab_jaakaardi_tegemisel_esthubi_voimalusi_19.03.2019.pdf

Today, it takes an average of 19 minutes for two people to make an inventory of one museum in the Museum Information System. For example, in a future shared repository or larger museums, inventorying a 2.5 million object will take 47.5 million minutes, or 90.3 years. This time is also the reason why it is often not possible to ensure the long-term preservation of all museum objects. One of the most important goals is to find a smart solution for controlling the condition and location of museums, based on the physical characteristics of each museum (eg material, age, condition) and the storage environment of the museum to determine the need and interval for inspections. If successful, this would allow time-consuming inventories to be abandoned in the future and replaced by needs-based controls. With the help of Kratt Säll, we want to take inventories and condition surveys of museums to a new level. The use of krat changes the traditional and very time-consuming work step, giving the custodian the information they need to make decisions quickly.

391,INZNAK Project - Intelligent road signs for adaptive vehicle traffic control, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8883382,"In response to the desire to improve road safety and vehicle traffic, the INZNAK project was proposed. This project aims to improve road traffic by developing and building a network of autonomous road signs. The use of intelligent road signs in road traffic will prevent the most common collisions on highways, resulting from speed not being adapted to weather conditions, the condition of the surface and damming? vehicles in the event of a need to brake suddenly. During the project, 3 types of signs will be developed: standing, hanging and mobile. Each sign will have a display that will present hints for drivers along with a suggested speed. Hints will be displayed in the form of text and image messages, which will warn or inform about current traffic disruptions. Thanks to the use of a string of signs placed along the road, drivers will be warned much faster about possible dangers on the road. This is due to the fact that each of the signs will communicate with the others, making it easier to manage traffic. The signs will communicate in LoraWan and LTE technology. LoraWan technology will enable the characters to communicate with each other. And LTE technology will be used to send and receive messages from the traffic control center. The use of two-level communication allows the solution to become independent from possible failures of the telecommunications infrastructure. To ensure the flow of up-to-date information to autonomous signs, it is necessary to equip them with a number of sensors, which will analyze the traffic in the vicinity of the sign on an ongoing basis. The experimental installations of intelligent signs will be equipped with sensors analyzing road traffic, such as: Doppler radar, lidar, acoustic probe, RGB camera, Bluetooth receiver. Due to the fact that changing weather conditions, such as: storms, blizzards, fog, black ice, are also a big risk on the road. A weather station will be installed in each sign, analyzing the current weather conditions around the sign. As a result, the resolution of weather measurements will be very high. The proposed approach to traffic analysis is based on the principles of multimodality, thanks to which it is possible to supplement each of the individual methods with a different one in a place where it better serves its purpose. Such a case can be observed e.g. at night, where standard vision cameras mainly capture car lights. The use of a lidar device in such conditions allows for proper detection of most vehicles. In the next chapter, individual modalities used in the conducted research will be presented.",Local,Poland,PL,Gdansk,Local Government,Economic affairs,Transport,Pilot,2019,,Learning,Machine learning,Computer vision,,,,"Analysis, monitoring and regulatory research",Monitoring policy implementation,Artificial Intelligence,G2C,Dynamic Data,Location Data,Improved Public Service,x,x,,x,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/mapa-innowacji

415,BOSCO - Distribution of financial aid, ,"In November 2017, the office of the Secretary of State for Energy released some software, known as BOSCO, to companies providing electricity. The aim of BOSCO was to determine whether people were entitled to financial aid to help; them with their electricity bills. The reasoning behind the ADM was twofold. Firstly, that it would make the process much easier for aid applicants (although, this didn’t seem to be the case judging by the large number of complaints the system received) and secondly, that it would also make the process easier and more efficient for the public utility companies.After receiving many reports that the software was not functioning properly, Civio, a Madrid-based non-profit investigative newsroom and citizen lobby, discovered that BOSCO was systematically denying aid to eligible applicants. Civio asked the government for the BOSCO source code to identify why those errors were happening. The request passed through three different ministries before ending up at the Committee for Transparency and Good Governance, which refused to share the code saying that it would violate copyright regulations (even though the software had been developed by the public administration itself).
In July 2019, Civio filed an administrative complaint arguing that the source code of any ADM system used by the public administration should be made public by default, in the same way that legal texts are made public. The case – which at the time of writing was ongoing – could end up at the Spanish Supreme Court, and could set a legal precedent.

417,Automated analysis of social media content, ,"In January 2018, the regional Government of Catalonia started a pilot project to try and measure the impact among the public of its STEMcat’s initiatives, a plan aimed at promoting scientific and technological vocations among young people.

For a month and a half, the Catalan government used Citibeats. This text-analysis software used machine-learning algorithms to collect and analyze around 12,000 tweets that spoke about the STEM disciplines in Catalonia. One of the insights the authorities said that they had gained was that women were more responsive to messages about natural sciences than about technology, according to the Catalan government’s PR. The authorities then used that and other insights to “optimize their strategy and propose new initiatives” to make young people interested in the STEM disciplines. The project was part of SmartCAT, the Catalan government’s strategy to become a smart region (as noted in this chapter, regional governments in Spain have a high degree of autonomy to develop their policies). The SmartCAT director said the software had allowed them “to evaluate in a more objective way the impact of the (government’s) initiatives” to make people interested in science and technology.

Citibeats, developed by Social Coin, a Barcelona-based start-up, was also used in December 2017 by the Barcelona municipality to gather people’s attitudes towards public transport and mobility in the city by analyzing around 30,000 comments by more than 15,000 people. In a case study of this project, Citibeats spoke of “citizens as sensors”.

In the two cases described above, and while the authorities praise the software’s ability to gather and analyze thousands of online comments (something it would take much more time and money to do using traditional survey methods), it’s not clear how representative those samples are and how valid the conclusions might be; and there doesn’t seem to be any information on how those analyses then influenced public policy.

Since March 2019, the regional government of Navarra has also been using the Citibeats software to detect online hate speech by analyzing text published on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

420,Smart video surveillance by the local police: Briefcam, ,"Since 2019, the local police in the cities of Kortrijk, Kuurne, and Lendelde (VLAS) have been using a ‘smart’ video surveillance system developed by an American company called Briefcam. According to the police, the goals of the system are as follows:
To aid. For instance, if a person with a backpack and wearing a blue coat has fled in a certain direction, this person can be found easily by the algorithm. The person is then traced on other cameras to get a more complete picture of the route he or she took and to detect crimes that might have been committed. The system can also help search for lost children and solve bicycle theft more easily.
The generation of live. For instance, at the beginning and end of the school day, trucks are not permitted to drive near schools. If a truck is spotted driving through an area it is not allowed to, the system sends an alert to the police.
Collect statistical information to support
The system stores all ‘objects’ (for example: people, small and large vehicles, and animals) that appear in the video images. An algorithm then decides what category each object belongs to, and, after this first categorization, a sub-categorization is made. For example, when it comes to people, the system categorizes each person as either a man, woman, or child before further categorizing by clothing: short/long sleeves, short/long trousers, color of clothing, and things such as hats, handbags, backpacks, etc. The same system of categorization is used for vehicles. For example, if the vehicle has two wheels: Is it a bicycle or a motorcycle? For different vehicles: Is it a car, pick-up, van, truck, or a bus? In addition, the direction, size, and velocity of the object are also registered. The system is also able to implement face recognition (PZVlas, 2019), although, at the moment, there is no legal framework to regulate use by the police. However, as the spokesperson of the VLAS police zone indicated in an interview: in exceptional circumstances, when requested by an investigatory judge, it is possible to use face recognition",Local,Belgium,BE,"Kortrijk, Kuurne, and Lendelde",Local Government,Public order and safety,Police Services,Implemented,2019,,Perception,Computer vision,Machine learning,,,,Enforcement,Smart Recognition processes,Artificial Intelligence,G2G,Dynamic Data,Location Data,FALSE,,,,,,Improved Administration Efficency,Improved Administrative Efficiency,,x,,x,,,,FALSE,,,,https://automatingsociety.algorithmwatch.org/report2020/belgium/
421,Algorithmic school registrations, ,"In many Belgian cities, there are problems when registering children for schools, especially when a lot of parents want to register their children at the same school. This has led to parents spending several nights in tents outside schools so that they can be the first to register their children. In response to this situation, which was considered unfair, several cities started organizing school registration via a central online system that uses an algorithm to decide in which school a child can be registered. In the system for primary schools, that is used in Leuven, a city east of Brussels, a number of variables are taken into account. On the basis of the answers given by the parents to a series of questions relating to the education level of the mother and whether or not the student receives a grant, students are then divided into ‘indicator students’ and ‘non-indicator students’. An indicator student is a student who is defined as having fewer life chances and is based upon the level of education of the mother and if the student is eligible for an education allowance. Further categorization happens on the basis of two criteria: distance from home to school and preference of school. The schools can decide how much weight they assign to distance and preference i.e. between 30%, 50%, or 70% for each (Meldjeaan, 2020). This weight can differ between cities, for instance, in Antwerp the schools have to assign a minimum of 50% to the distance criterium. For secondary schools, some cities also use an online registration system, which uses an algorithm to decide which school the child will go to. However, the system is not the same as for primary schools. As not every municipality has a secondary school, the distance criterium is considered discriminatory and, therefore, it is not taken up (Dierickx and Berlanger, 2019). The system does take into account priority students (i.e., children of the staff of the school) and indicator-students (see above). The algorithm works randomly on the basis of the first choice in three rounds (Aanmelden school, 2020). As the system does not take distance into account, this has led to situations where students from Brussels took up places in Flemish secondary schools outside of Brussels, and children, living close to the school not getting in and having to be registered in schools much farther away (Dierickx and Berlanger, 2019).",Local,Belgium,BE,Leuven,Local Government,Education,Pre-primary and primary education.,Implemented,2020,,Reasoning,Automated reasoning,Planning and Scheduling,,,,Public services and engagement,Service integration (various),Artificial Intelligence,G2C,Dynamic Data,Streaming Data,Improved Public Service,,,,x,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,https://automatingsociety.algorithmwatch.org/report2020/belgium/

423,Taxation and the automatization of property evaluation, ,"For years, and with varying degrees of success, the Danish government has tried to centralize and automate tax administration. Attempts to centralize and automate tax collection in 2005 with EFI (Et Fælles Inddrivelsessystem or One Shared Tax collection system) failed, and EFI was shelved in 2015 (Alfter, 2019, 51). A new system, to collect billions of Danish crowns owed by taxpayers, was expected to be finalized by mid-2019, however, in September 2019, the Auditors of the Danish Parliament, Rigsrevision, published a critical report indicating that tax collection would only be fully up and running by the end of 2020, or later (Rigsrevisionen, 2019).

Missing out on collecting billions of Danish crowns in tax revenue, however, is just one of several automatization concerns on the table of every new minister of finance. One heated discussion is about automatizing the estimation of property values – particularly in a context where housing costs are growing significantly in the capital and near larger cities while they are dropping elsewhere, thus affecting property owners in a country where large parts of the population own their own home.

Passed in 2017, the Ejendomsvurderingslov (law on property assessment, 2017) states that automatic real estate valuation assessment will become standard practice. In preparation for the law, this fully automated system was described as “machine assessments” (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 36-37). The system is set to include “sales prices related to the neighborhood, location and size. Sales price levels are adjusted to take into account the distance to forests and recreation areas, schools, streets, railways”. The system will also take into account whether or not there is the possibility to build on the surrounding terrain and whether or not ground pollution is an issue (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 37). A total of 19 parameters will be used to automatically calculate property value (Version2 Editorial, 2019). A preparatory committee prepared an analysis to guide the government ahead of the legislation. The committee followed the overall line to move from “subjective to objective” assessments, from human to digital assessments, and from manual to automatic administration, to improve assessments and lower administration costs (Engbergudvalget, 2014, p. 68-69). While it does not explicitly mention it, this model uses a level of machine learning to develop a “statistical predictive model” (Motzfeldt & Abkenar, 2019, p. 37). Furthermore, the overall assumption of the preparatory committee was that machine assessments were more objective than human assessments, where human assessments are considered subjective.

As with many other systems, the automated property assessment system has been significantly delayed. Along the way, fears surfaced that it did not comply with Danish administrative law (Mølsted, 2018). It also proved to be more expensive than the estimate in the initial report regarding the cost of a property valuation calculated by a human (Motzfeldt, 2019-2). This project, and other problematic attempts by the Danish tax authorities to incorporate IT projects, have been described as “the ministers’ (…) IT-phantoms” (Version2 Editorial, 2019). The law to assess property values allows a variation of 40% in the value of a given property – 20% either side of the price calculated by the system – “and one does not need to hold a PhD in human behavior to predict that this will lead to protests if or when the system comes into use. Worst case we will see headlines that two newly built and identical houses will be taxed very differently. Could we blame citizens if they ask critical questions why they had to spend billions for a system with such a low level of precision” (Motzfeldt, 2019-2).",National,Denmark,DK,Danish Tax Authority,Central-Government,General public services,"Executive and legislative organs, financial and fiscal affairs, external affairs.",Implemented,2021,,Reasoning,Automated reasoning,Planning and Scheduling,,,,Enforcement,Predictive enforcement processes,Artificial Intelligence,G2G,Dynamic Data,Streaming Data,FALSE,,,,,,Improved Administration Efficency,Improved Administrative Efficiency,,,x,,,,,FALSE,,,,https://automatingsociety.algorithmwatch.org/report2020/denmark/
424,"Exam control in schools: fighting fraud or profiling students?
", ,"You try to control me, I outsmart you. This was the logic of a Danish high school student who, in a post on Github, described how to disable a digital exam monitor (Schou, 2019). The move was part of massive protests by the students against The Digital Exam Monitor, developed by the Danish Ministry of Education (Den Digitale Prøvevagt), and which was set to roll out in spring 2019. Following the protests against this surveillance, which included copies of the clipboard, active websites in four browsers, a key logger, a screen dump every minute, or whenever an active window changed, detection of virtual machines in the background, a list of all active programs, various unique IDs, etc.) (Møller Kjemtrup, 2019), the ministry of education put the tool on hold (Undervisningsministeriet, 2019). Yet under the new social democrat government, students continue to ask the authorities to shelve it entirely (Mejlgaard, 2019). Meanwhile, another tool that uses machine learning to detect exam fraud has been developed at Copenhagen University. This move stirred new controversies and fears about student profiling in 2019. In 2014, high school software provider Macom supplied a tool called Lectio, which operated as an early detection system to trace students in danger of dropping out (Copenha- gen University, 2014). The tool was developed by university students and based upon information gathered through the administration and communication system used by 9 out of 10 Danish high schools, according to Macom and media reports. However, use of the algorithm was stopped about a week after it was introduced. The data used to develop it had been handed to a third party – the university and its master’s students – without permission from the high schools (Møllerhøj, 2015). More recently, in May 2019, a group at the same department of Copenhagen University published a machine learning system by the name of Ghostwriter. The developers said that it could be used to trace the writing style of students in assignments and that it could detect with some certainty, whether or not a student had submitted a text written by someone else. The aim of Ghostwriter was to fight exam fraud, but (the university wrote in a press release) that the model could also be applied elsewhere to detect texts written in an unusual style (Copenhagen University, 2019). The machine learning was based upon 130,000 student assignments held in the Lectio system by Macom. The ensuing controversy between the high schools, the university professor, and the director of Macom focused on a breach of contract related to the handling of the students’ data: “We feel unsafe when the data handling agreement is not respected,” a representative of the high schools stated to online technology news website Version2, (Bang Frederiksen, 2019-1; Bang Frederiksen, 2019-2; Bang Frederiksen, 2019-3).",National,Denmark,DK,Danish Ministry of Education,Central-Government,Education,Education not definable by level.,Implemented,2019,,Learning,Machine learning,Natural language processing,,,,Enforcement,Predictive enforcement processes,Artificial Intelligence,G2G,Dynamic Data,Streaming Data,FALSE,,,,,,Improved Administration Efficency,Improved Administrative Efficiency,,,x,,,,,FALSE,,,,https://automatingsociety.algorithmwatch.org/report2020/denmark/
425,The Youth Guarantee Support System (YGSS) to identifying young people not in education or employment, ,"Since 2018, municipal governments in Estonia have been able to use a tool called The Youth Guarantee Support System (YGSS) (Mis on noortegarantii tugisüsteem? – Tööelu.ee o. J.). This tool helps case managers (social workers, child protection officers, youth workers, etc.) identify young people aged 16-26 who are not in education, employment or training (NEET). It is used to support them when they need to return to education or enter the labor market. Case managers of the Youth Guarantee Support System or the municipal government employees can see information about young people living in their specific locality. However, up until now, not all of the municipalities have joined the program. In order to join, the municipal governments have to send an application to the Municipal Government Information System for Social Services and Benefits (STAR). The case managers or municipal government employees are then shown a list in the STAR system of all the NEET youth who are registered as residents in a specific municipal area and who – according to other registry data – need help. This information is based on data from nine different registries, creating, therefore, a very comprehensive dataset that includes information on the young person’s address, email, phone number, educational background, and if they studied in Estonian or Russian. Young people have the right to forbid the analysis by a case manager, and in cases where the data is processed, young people must give their consent.  The case manager then contacts the young people identified by the system and a letter or an SMS is sent to each person asking them to complete a survey. The Youth Guarantee Support System Request is automatically triggered twice a year (15.03 and 15.10).",National,Estonia,EE,Various municipalities in Estonia,Local Government,Social protection,Unemployment.,Implemented,2018,,Reasoning,Knowledge representation,Automated reasoning,,,,"Analysis, monitoring and regulatory research",Information analysis processes,Artificial Intelligence,G2G,Historical Data,Historical Data,FALSE,,,,,,Improved Administration Efficency,Improved Administrative Efficiency,,,x,,,,,FALSE,,,,https://automatingsociety.algorithmwatch.org/report2020/estonia/

Costa Rica is also involved in the project by allowing access to its medical billing database (to look at clinical/socio-economic data not included in EHIF databases).

The pilot was officially launched in January 2017. Throughout the pilot, family practitioners joined a series of webinars, led by the local pilot coordinator (World Bank consultant), to reinforce and refresh the initial training. This solution contributes to the empowerment of primary care and also helps find the best algorithm to predict which patients with selected diagnoses are likely to be admitted to the hospital. The solution first identifies certain medical conditions/diagnoses in the EHIF’s medical invoice data- base. It then provides a practical model for family physicians to predict which patients are more likely to be admitted to the hospital or suffer other health problems.

429,Automatic identification of individual risk factors in social care and healthcare , ,"In October 2019, the Japanese multinational IT service provider, Fujitsu, announced that it was developing an AI solution for South Karelia’s social care and healthcare district (known by its Finnish acronym Eksote). The project employs machine learning methods with the aim of helping Eksote identify factors underlying social exclusion of young adults, as well as predicting associated risks. With the predictive model, social and healthcare professionals will be provided an overview of risk factors. According to Fujitsu’s press release, the model identifies some 90% of young adults susceptible to social exclusion. In practical terms, the model that is being used is derived from pseudonymized data taken from the use of Eksote’s services by young adults, and it uses this data to predict social exclusion outcomes defined by Eksote’s professionals. According to Eksote, the legislation on the secondary and combined use of healthcare data makes it possible to use only non-identifiable, pseudonymized data. This means that Fujitsu’s model cannot be used to identify individual young adults considered to be at risk of social exclusion; rather, the model produces a list of risk factors on a general level. The next step in the project is to examine whether it is possible, under the current legislation, to set up a consent-based system: a client’s consent would be asked for before using the predictive model on their individual data when they, for example, have an appointment with a social care or healthcare professional.

The aim was to identify problems early on, so that an intervention could be made and support provided to families sooner rather than later. Much like in the 2019 project on young adults and social exclusion, this model was based on explicitly defined undesired “endpoints”: low-grade averages, disciplinary interventions at school, high-class non-attendance figures, being taken into custody, acceptance into psychiatric care, and substance abuse. The model made use of data gathered from the IT systems of maternity clinics, kindergartens, schools, healthcare, and mental healthcare providers, as well as social services – e.g., it combined data from different administrative branches, namely social care, healthcare, and education. The outcome was the identification of a total of 1340 risk factors, ranging from bad teeth in children, to parents missing maternity clinic appointments, to the child’s siblings bullying others at school. These examples also give an idea of the kinds of data that were employed when making predictions.

XLAW is software that uses probabilistic, machine learning-powered solution for trends and pattern discovery in crimes. This implies that one can deduce — or more accurately, induce — how criminal behavior will unfold, before it has happened, by intelligent analysis of the criminal history of a location over time. Lombardo claims to have done this by carefully analyzing 20 years of data and also by calling on his experience in the field. As a result, thanks to XLAW, law enforcement officials can be alerted and deployed on the scene before a crime has even happened. At the same time, XLAW provides police officers with details as precise as “genre, height, citizenship, distinguishing features, and biometrics” of a potential suspect.XLAW has a strong predictive component to it.

The system consists of many connected databases (Ministry of Public Administration, 2009) and was designed to optimize the work process for social workers, evaluate their work, and prevent errors when processing applications for social welfare. The system has been upgraded since its introduction and that it now includes AI, ADM, and machine learning capabilities.

For example, citizens can use ADM to learn their social rights and see a prediction of benefit payments so that they can make an informed evaluation and calculation before applying for social benefits. Furthermore, the application processes for several social rights/benefits is fully automated, e.g., to research previous decisions related to social benefits and to see new (informative) ones for particular applicants. E-sociala can also detect people from the same family and access their financial information, thereby simplifying the process for social workers.

The goal is to further automate the process so that the system can create a full “social rights profile” for every applicant. The system will then be able to see what benefits a particular citizen is eligible for, for how long, and for what amount of money. For legal reasons, social workers still need to personally evaluate, print, sign and send every application.

A dataset from a higher education institution is used to build classification models to predict academic performance of students. The dataset includes information known at the time of student’s enrollment – academic path, demographics and social-economic factors. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task, in which there’s a strong imbalance towards one of the classes. Algorithms to promote class balancing with synthetic oversampling are tested, and classification models are trained and evaluated, both with standard machine learning algorithms and state of the art boosting algorithms. Our results show that boosting algorithms respond better to the specific classification task than standard methods.

Inspired by Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, it establishes that the flow of mobility between two places, for example two neighborhoods of a city, is proportional to their population and inversely proportional to their geographical distance.In practice, the gravitational model is often inaccurate because it is based on only two variables, distance and population, and is unable to capture complex relationships between them.
The Institute of Science and Information Technologies of the National Research Council (Cnr-Isti) together with the Bruno Kessler Foundation of Trento and the Argonne National Laboratory in the USA, has developed ""Deep Gravity"", an algorithm that adds to the gravitational model two fundamental ingredients, namely: the use of different variables that describe the points of interest in a place such as restaurants, hotels, hospitals and streets, and the ability to capture complex relationships between these variables thanks to the use of deep learning.",Across Countries,Italy,IT,ISTI-CNT (National Research Center),Governmental,General public services,General services.,Pilot,2021,,Learning,Machine learning,Knowledge representation,,,,Public services and engagement,Service personalisation (various),Artificial Intelligence,G2G,Historical Data,Historical Data,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,https://www.lescienze.it/news/2021/11/12/news/deep_gravity_l_algoritmo_che_spiega_come_si_muovono_le_persone-4981135/

The aim is to grant as much freedom as possible, given the patient health and mental situation. If people can move around more, they stay fit longer both physically and mentally, the organisation argues. The organisation also emphasizes that the ICT tool is above all a supportive tool and that the most important element still is the (risk) assessment of the patient.
The eHealth innovation was an example of how such technologies can support health professionals, as personal health data is collected, stored and communicated between relevant stakeholders.

The platform, accessible via credentials, monitors information flows from Twitter, Reddit, Wikipedia and Google Trends in real time. The platform allows the collection, analysis, aggregation and display of data extracted from different sources. This is possible thanks to the construction of the platform on three different levels (layers): the Data layer, the Analysis layer and the Visualization layer.
The Data layer constantly collects raw data from the web and social media, pre-processes them through an initial screening and an initial cleaning of the raw data, obtained through the relative Application Programmer Interface, API: Twitter API, Reddit API, Google Trends API. To collect the data, keyword filters were used, created and validated through a structured framework, on the basis of recurrence and relevance criteria (6).
The Analysis layer has the function of analyzing the processed and cleaned data through the generation of graphs, thus making the extracted data understandable and relating them to each other. The processes that allow the geolocalization of tweets take place on this layer, and two processes based on machine learning algorithms: Influencer analysis and Early-signal detection:
Influencer analysis makes it possible to identify the most influential and most active users in the conversation about vaccines on Twitter, with the aim of monitoring the crucial ""nodes"" of the communities involved, both in vaccine-friendly communities and in the no vax community;
Early-signal detection allows the interception of users who use new hashtags, therefore users new to the topic of vaccines. The hashtag (created by inserting the # key in front of the desired word or phrase, for example, #vaccini or #iononmivaccino) is a tool that serves as a thematic aggregator on some social networks and was introduced by Twitter as a keyword signal and to draw users' attention to some particular words or themes.

Authorities in the city want to address the health and safety concerns of residents and visitors enduring excessive noise from modified exhaust systems on cars, motorbikes and other vehicles travelling on the Stalenstraat.
Nokia is deploying its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Scene Analytics technology for the proof-of-concept project. The solution utilises data from microphones and installed cameras, used as IoT sensors along the road. If an approaching vehicle exceeds the pre-determined threshold, the street-deployed microphones and cameras begin recording.
Nokia Scene Analytics adds intelligence to the event data transmitted from the sensors using a decibel-powered algorithm for audio analysis and automated number plate recognition (ANPR). This information is sent to authorities who receive quantified observations and orientations in order to make informed decisions on ‘if’ and ’how’ they will address the issue.",Local,Belgium,BE22,City of Genk,Local Government,Environmental protection,Environmental protection n.e.c.,Planned,2021,,Perception,Audio processing,Machine learning,,,Intelligent Object,"Analysis, monitoring and regulatory research",Monitoring policy implementation,Artificial Intelligence,G2G,Dynamic Data,Location Data,FALSE,,,,,,Improved Administration Efficency,Improved Administrative Efficiency,,x,,,,,,FALSE,,,,Belgian city uses artificial intelligence to tackle noise pollution
